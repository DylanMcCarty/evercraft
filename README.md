# EVERCRAFT 

### This is a project to create and test character classes against eachother and create a D&D-like game 

-------
The goal was to make a game that can play classes against eachother and have outcomes 
related to the expected outcomes that would happen in D&D based on a "Kata" linked [Here](https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata)
